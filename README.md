## Differences With Default Epic Stack

- Added react-admin dependencies
- Add 2 routes under the `app/routes/admim+` directory
  - `$.tsx`: the react-admin frontend
  - `api.$.tsx`: the react-admin API

## Description

The `api.$.tsx` contains a `loader` and an `action` that translate react-admin queries to Prisma.
